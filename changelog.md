- Implemented 3-second first customer delay to prevent overwhelming new players
- Added `enableCustomerSpawning()` public method for UI to trigger spawning after mount
- Modified `tick()` method to respect spawning enabled flag and first customer delay
- Updated App.tsx to call `enableCustomerSpawning()` in useEffect after component mount
- Added `firstCustomerDelay: 3000` constant to TIMING configuration
- Customer spawning now controlled by two-stage process:
  - Stage 1: Wait 3 seconds after enableCustomerSpawning() is called
  - Stage 2: First customer spawns, then regular 5-second intervals resume
- Updated all 9 customer spawning tests to account for new behavior:
  - Tests now call `enableCustomerSpawning()` before advancing timers
  - First customer spawns at 3 seconds, subsequent customers at 5-second intervals
  - Added new test verifying customers don't spawn until spawning is enabled
  - Added test for first customer delay timing

**Technical Details:**

- Added `calculateOrderProcessingTime()` private method to BagelTycoonEngine:
  - Applies speed multiplier per station: `baseTime / (1 + (equipmentLevel - 1) * 0.25)`
  - Parallel processing (max time) when all stations involved have managers
  - Series processing (sum of times) when any station lacks a manager
  - Handles both food-only and food + beverage orders correctly
  - Accounts for different equipment levels across multiple stations

  - Shows ingredient cost inline and disables/greys out when storage capacity is reached or funds are insufficient.
  - Provides small helper text for 'Storage Full' or 'Insufficient funds' next to the tag.

**Testing:**

- ✅ Visual/manual verification: tag-style button matches ingredient tags and shows dashed border.
- ✅ Disabled state verified when storage capacity reached; shows muted text and prevents clicks.

### Fixed - 2026-02-01

#### BT-015: Sales Ticker & Interactive Ledger

- Added `SalesTicker` button in the `Header` to cycle recent sales (last 5) beside the money display.
- Ticker cycles through entries every 2 seconds and shows `+${finalPrice}` with a speed icon (⚡, ⭐, ⏱, 🐢).
- Clicking the ticker opens the `DailyLedger` modal to inspect the full recent-sales list (up to 5 records) with timestamps and speed labels.
- Connected UI to engine `salesHistory` produced by `BagelTycoonEngine` so ledger updates in real-time.
- Updated App to manage ledger modal state and pass `salesHistory` into `Header`.

**Testing:**

- ✅ Manual UI verification: ticker cycles and opens ledger modal
- ✅ Unit/engine compatibility: uses existing `SaleRecord` data with no engine changes required

#### BUG-003: CSS Not Rendering

- Fixed CSS rendering issue by adding PostCSS configuration for Tailwind CSS v4
- Created `postcss.config.js` with `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin to enable CSS processing
- Installed `@tailwindcss/postcss` package as devDependency
- Refactored `.btn-primary` and `.btn-disabled` classes to avoid circular `@apply` references
- All Tailwind utility classes now render correctly in the browser

**Technical Details:**

- Tailwind CSS v4 requires separate PostCSS plugin (`@tailwindcss/postcss`) instead of using `tailwindcss` directly
- Updated button component classes to expand all utilities inline instead of using `@apply btn`
- Build generates 22.79 KB CSS bundle with proper Tailwind utilities

#### BUG-002: getState() Map Type Preservation

- Fixed `getState()` method in BagelTycoonEngine to preserve Map type when returning state to React components
- StationGrid and other components can now use `.get()` method on stations Map without runtime errors

- Proper deep cloning of all nested arrays and objects (unlockedIngredients, activeOrder, etc.)
- Preserves Map type compatibility with GameState interface
- Updated test helper `getStations()` to use `Object.fromEntries()` for test access

#### BUG-1: mergeWithDefaults Empty Stations Fix

- Fixed `mergeWithDefaults()` method in BagelTycoonEngine to preserve default stations when partial state doesn't include them
- Engine instances can now be created with partial state (e.g., `{ money: 1000 }`) without losing station initialization
- Added 3 regression tests to prevent future occurrences
- All 71 unit tests passing

**Technical Details:**

- Modified `mergeWithDefaults()` to check if `partial.stations` exists before attempting conversion
- Falls back to `defaults.stations` when partial state omits stations property
- Prevents empty Map from overwriting properly initialized default stations
