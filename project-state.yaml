    issue: "mergeWithDefaults Creates Empty Stations Map"
    fix: "Engine instances can now be created with partial state (e.g., `{ money: 1000 }`) without losing station initialization"
memo_from_last_run: "BT-009 completed: POS Layout & Shell implemented with Tailwind 4. Created 2-column layout (33% sidebar, 66% main). Header component displays logo (🥯 emoji in rounded amber box), 'BAGEL TYCOON' title with amber accent, random tagline from PRD pool selected on mount, and real-time money counter with tabular numerals. Engine successfully integrated with React via subscription pattern. All 118 tests passing. No linter or build errors. EPIC-3 in progress."
