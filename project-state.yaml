memo_from_last_run: "BT-013 completed: Queue Spawning Fix & Delay implemented. Added customer spawning control system with enableCustomerSpawning() method. Implemented 3-second first customer delay. Modified tick() to respect spawning enabled flag and first customer delay. Updated App.tsx to call enableCustomerSpawning() after mount. Added firstCustomerDelay constant (3000ms) to TIMING. Updated 9 customer spawning tests. All 136 tests passing (118 engine + 9 spawning + 9 Register). No linter or build errors. Next: BT-014 Lucide Icon Integration."
