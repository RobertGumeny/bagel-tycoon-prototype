    issue: "mergeWithDefaults Creates Empty Stations Map"
    fix: "Engine instances can now be created with partial state (e.g., `{ money: 1000 }`) without losing station initialization"
memo_from_last_run: "BT-008 completed: Pricing and speed bonus logic fully implemented. Quality multiplier calculated from all stations involved (1 + sum((qualityLevel - 1) * 0.12)). Speed bonus tiers implemented: lightning (1.5x at <50% time), good (1.2x at <100%), normal (1.0x at <200%), slow (0.7x at ≥200%). Final price = basePrice * qualityMultiplier * speedBonus. Sales logged to history with all bonus details. Added 15 new tests. All 118 tests passing. EPIC-2 complete."
