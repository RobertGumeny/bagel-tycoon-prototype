memo_from_last_run: "BT-012 completed: Cash Register Station & Order Automation implemented. Created Register component positioned below ActiveOrder. Implemented Take Order button (calls engine.takeOrder()) and Hire Register Manager button ($250). Visual styling uses dashed border when unautomated, solid card when manager hired. Added 17 component tests. Installed React testing libraries (@testing-library/react, user-event, jest-dom). All 135 tests passing (118 engine + 17 Register). No linter or build errors. Next: BT-013 Queue Spawning Fix."
