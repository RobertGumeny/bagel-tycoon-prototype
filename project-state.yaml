memo_from_last_run: "BT-011 completed: Station Grid & Modals implemented. Created StationCard component showing locked/unlocked states with color-coded styling per PRD palette. Created StationGrid component with 2x3 grid layout for all 6 stations. Created StationModal component with 2-column upgrade layout (Equipment/Quality), manager hiring, storage upgrades, and ingredient management with tags. All buttons hide when player lacks sufficient funds. All upgrade costs calculated correctly using exponential formulas. All 118 tests passing. No linter or build errors. EPIC-3 in progress."
