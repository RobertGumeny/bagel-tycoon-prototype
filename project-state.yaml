    issue: "mergeWithDefaults Creates Empty Stations Map"
    fix: "Engine instances can now be created with partial state (e.g., `{ money: 1000 }`) without losing station initialization"
memo_from_last_run: "BT-007 completed: Order processing logic implemented with speed multipliers and parallel/series processing. Speed multiplier applies per station: baseTime / (1 + (equipmentLevel - 1) * 0.25). Parallel processing (max time) when all stations have managers, series processing (sum of times) otherwise. Added 11 new tests covering speed multipliers, parallel/series logic, and beverage combinations. All 103 tests passing. EPIC-2 complete. Ready to proceed with BT-008 (Pricing & Speed Bonus Logic)."
