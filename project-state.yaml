    issue: "mergeWithDefaults Creates Empty Stations Map"
    fix: "Engine instances can now be created with partial state (e.g., `{ money: 1000 }`) without losing station initialization"
memo_from_last_run: "BT-010 completed: Active Order & Queue UI implemented. Created CustomerQueue component with 5 emoji avatar slots (filled/empty states with smooth animations). Created ActiveOrder component with empty state message, order name display, smooth progress bar (updates every 100ms), and countdown timer. Both components integrated into sidebar with proper spacing. All 118 tests passing. No linter or build errors. EPIC-3 in progress."
