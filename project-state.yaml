memo_from_last_run: "BT-014 completed: Lucide Icon Integration & Button Styling implemented. Added station-specific icons (Utensils, Refrigerator, Coffee, Beef, Flame, Zap) mapped to each station type. Displayed icons prominently at top of station cards. Refactored 'Click to Manage' text into high-contrast button (dark bg, white text) centered at bottom of card with border separator. Added hover:scale-[0.98] to all station cards for interactivity feedback. Centered station names. All 136 tests passing. No linter or build errors. Next: BT-015 Sales Ticker & Interactive Ledger."
